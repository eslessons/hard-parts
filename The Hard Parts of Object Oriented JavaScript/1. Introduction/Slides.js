/* Introduction

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OOP - an enormously popular paradigm for structuring our
complex code
— Easy to add features and functionality
— Easy for us and other developers to reason about (a
clear structure)
— Performant (efficient in terms of memory)
We need to organize our code as it gets more complex
so it's not just an endless series of commands
